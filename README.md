# Shadow Creator
One of the Linear Algebra Course projects, in which the program gets an image with white background as an input and creates a shadow for the object. You can set the angle of the shadow with the first argument, and define the name of the source image with the second argument in this way: `shadowize.py [coefficient] [filename]`

Here are some examples:

in1: 
![input1](/examples/parrot.jpg)

out1: 
![output1](/examples/parrot_edited.jpg)

in1: 
![input2](/examples/tree.jpg)

out1: 
![output2](/examples/tree_edited.jpg)
